## 🐛 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Date parsing error in Cell 3  
**Cause:** CSV format `2021-Q3` was being incorrectly parsed  
**Solution:** Changed to `pd.PeriodIndex()` for proper quarter handling  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND TESTED

## 🚀 3 COMMANDS TO RUN EVERYTHING

### 1. Install Dependencies (30 seconds)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Jupyter (5 seconds)
```bash
jupyter notebook rivian_analysis.ipynb
```

### 3. Run All Cells (60 seconds)
In Jupyter, click: **`Cell → Run All`**

## 📊 What You'll Get

After running, check the `outputs/` folder:

**✅ 9 Plots (300 DPI, presentation-ready):**
- Model 1: pred_vs_actual, feature_importance, residuals
- Model 2: beta_trends, beta_heatmap, alpha_trend  
- Model 3: cluster_pca, regime_timeline, regime_features

**✅ 1 Text File:**
- insights_summary.txt (all 3 model insights + synthesis)

---

## ✅ Verification Command

After running, verify outputs:
```bash
ls -la outputs/
```

You should see **10 files total** (9 PNG + 1 TXT).

## 🎯 If Everything Works

You'll see this at the end of the notebook:
```
✅ Insights exported to: outputs/insights_summary.txt
================================================================================
🎉 ALL MODELS COMPLETE!
================================================================================

📊 OUTPUTS GENERATED:
  - Model 1: 3 plots (pred_vs_actual, feature_importance, residuals)
  - Model 2: 3 plots (beta_trends, beta_heatmap, alpha_trend)
  - Model 3: 3 plots (cluster_pca, regime_timeline, regime_features)

📝 INSIGHTS:
  - All insights exported to: outputs/insights_summary.txt

✅ Ready for Point72 pitch!
