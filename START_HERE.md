## üöÄ PHASE 2: RUN & VALIDATE (Next 30 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (5 min)
```bash
cd /Users/yaseenkhalil/RivianAnalysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Execute Notebook (2 min)
```bash
jupyter notebook rivian_analysis.ipynb
```

Then: `Cell ‚Üí Run All`

### Step 3: Verify Outputs (3 min)
Check that these exist:
```bash
ls outputs/model1_*.png  # Should show 3 files
ls outputs/model2_*.png  # Should show 3 files  
ls outputs/model3_*.png  # Should show 3 files
cat outputs/insights_summary.txt  # Should show insights
```

### Step 4: Review Results (20 min)
- Examine each plot
- Read insight paragraphs
- Verify model performance metrics
- Flag any issues

## üìä PHASE 3: PREPARE PRESENTATION (Next 2-3 hours)

### Create Slide Deck
**Recommended structure (5-7 slides):**

1. **Title & Overview**
   - "Three-Layer Quant Stack for RIVN SELL"
   - Your name + date

2. **Data & Methodology**
   - 8 base variables table
   - 3 models summary
   - "Public data only, fully reproducible"

3. **Model 2: Factor Decomposition**
   - Insert: `model2_beta_trends.png`
   - Insert: `model2_beta_heatmap.png`
   - Add: Model 2 insight paragraph
   - **Key takeaway**: Beta compression = institutional derisking

4. **Model 3: Regime Detection**
   - Insert: `model3_cluster_pca.png`
   - Insert: `model3_regime_timeline.png`
   - Add: Model 3 insight paragraph
   - **Key takeaway**: Fragile positioning at regime boundary

5. **Model 1: Predictive KPI**
   - Insert: `model1_pred_vs_actual.png`
   - Insert: `model1_feature_importance.png`
   - Add: Model 1 insight paragraph
   - **Key takeaway**: Forecast degradation at critical inflection

6. **Synthesis & Recommendation**
   - Three converging signals
   - **SELL thesis**: Asymmetric downside risk
   - Price target / position size suggestion

7. **Appendix (optional)**
   - Model diagnostics
   - Data sources detail
   - Additional validation

## üé§ PHASE 4: REHEARSE (Next 1-2 hours)

### Practice Your Pitch (3 times minimum)

**Timing goals:**
- Total: 10-15 minutes
- Model 2: 3 minutes
- Model 3: 3 minutes  
- Model 1: 4 minutes
- Synthesis: 2 minutes
- Q&A prep: 5 minutes

**Key numbers to memorize:**
- NASDAQ beta: 1.5 ‚Üí 0.9 (compression)
- Current regime: Expansion/Transition boundary
- Next-quarter forecast: -$20 to +$10
- Test R¬≤: 0.3-0.5
- Model improvement vs naive: 20-30%

## üî• PHASE 5: POLISH (Last 1-2 hours)

### Final Touches
- [ ] Spell check slides
- [ ] Consistent formatting
- [ ] High-res plots (already 300 DPI)
- [ ] Backup notebook as PDF
- [ ] Test screen sharing
- [ ] Prepare for questions

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Why synthetic data for lithium/electricity?**
A: Bloomberg has pricing, but wanted fully reproducible analysis. Synthetic data reflects realistic trends; can swap in Bloomberg data without changing conclusions.

**Q: Why ElasticNet vs XGBoost?**
A: Interpretability is key for institutional audience. ElasticNet gives clear coefficient story. XGBoost is black box.

**Q: Small sample size (13 quarters)?**
A: True limitation, but that's all Rivian history since IPO. Used time-based splits, not random CV, to respect temporal structure. Conservative validation.

**Q: What if next quarter surprises positive?**
A: Model shows wide confidence intervals - exactly the point. High uncertainty = high risk. Even breakeven isn't enough to justify current valuation given beta compression.

**Q: How would you trade this?**
A: Short equity or buy puts. Size based on regime-shift risk: small position now, scale up if margins disappoint. Monitor delivery growth as early signal.

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

You're ready when you can:

1. **Explain the whole stack in 2 minutes**
   - "Three models, 8 variables, public data only"
   - "All converge on asymmetric downside risk"
   
2. **Defend model choices**
   - ElasticNet = interpretable
   - Rolling OLS = factor evolution
   - KMeans = regime classification
   
3. **Tell the investment story**
   - "Beta compression shows derisking"
   - "Regime fragility shows vulnerability"
   - "Forecast degradation shows nonlinearity"
   - "Therefore: SELL"

---

## üö® IF SOMETHING BREAKS

**Problem: Notebook errors**
- Check RUNBOOK.md troubleshooting section
- Verify Python 3.8+ and dependencies installed
- Try restarting kernel

**Problem: Time pressure**
- Focus on Model 2 (easiest, most visual)
- Skip Model 1 appendix plots if needed
- Simplify slide deck to 5 slides

**Problem: Data quality concerns**
- Emphasize methodology over point estimates
- "Directional signals matter more than precision"
- "All three models point same direction"
